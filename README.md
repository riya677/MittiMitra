**Intelligent Soil Health Assessment and Integrated Nutrient Management for Indian Farmers**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Mitti Mitra** is an innovative AgriTech solution developed as a B.Tech project to address the critical issue of **soil health deterioration** in Indian agriculture. It is a smart, user-friendly **mobile application** designed to empower farmers with accessible, real-time soil analysis and tailored nutrient recommendations, moving them away from unsustainable farming practices.

## 🎯 Objective of the Project

The main goal is to create the clever, user-friendly smartphone application "Mitti Mitra," which will provide Indian farmers with easily available resources for **sustainable farming**. The core objectives are:

* **AI-Powered Soil Assessment:** Develop an AI system that utilizes a smartphone's camera to provide a **real-time, first-level evaluation of soil health** (approximating NPK levels, organic carbon, etc.).
* **Customized Recommendation Engine:** Create a recommendation engine that generates **location-specific and customized Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) strategies**.
* **Reduce Reliance on Traditional Testing:** Lessen farmers' dependence on costly, time-consuming, and frequently unavailable laboratory-based soil testing.
* **Promote Sustainability:** Address the long-term problem of soil deterioration by encouraging the use of **organic inputs and balanced fertilization**.
* **User-Centric Design:** Provide farmers with an easy-to-use interface, catering to different levels of digital literacy, to help them increase crop yields and farm profitability in a sustainable manner.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Progressive **land degradation** is among the most pernicious issues affecting Indian agriculture. Intensive farming practices, driven by the Green Revolution, have led to the **overuse and imbalance of chemical fertilizers**, particularly urea.

**Key Issues Faced by Farmers:**
1.  **Diminishing Returns:** Depletion of vital micronutrients and decreased organic carbon content forces farmers into a cycle of applying more inputs for the same or lower yields.
2.  **Inaccessibility of Testing:** Traditional lab-based soil tests are **time-consuming, costly, and often geographically unreachable** for smallholders.
3.  **Generalized Advice:** Farmers are forced to rely on educated guesswork or general fertilizer recommendations that are not customized to their unique soil and crop requirements.

**Mitti Mitra** aims to break this cycle by offering an immediate, accessible, and affordable alternative to inform balanced nutrient application.
